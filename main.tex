\section{Summary}
I am a strong, social, and driven person with a passion for computer science and programming. My experience with software development spans from low-level programming for embedded systems, to high-level programming for desktops, mobile, and web. It has been said about me that I understand the customers needs, that I am a competent team player, and that I bring a positive energy to the work group. My core values are creativity, knowledge and progress.
