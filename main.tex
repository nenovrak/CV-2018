\section{Research Merits}
\subsection{Research Profile}
My research has mainly involved using resource-constrained computer systems to build small, power-efficient, and smart wearable systems. In my work I have worked with computer programming ranging from embedded systems to web. The methodology has been practical in nature, and the aim is to have results be readily implemented in real-life applications.

\subsection{Research Projects}
No project work has been performed after PhD graduation.

\subsubsection{Planned Research}
Continued research on how to make more efficient systems using resource-constrained devices.

\section{Pedagogics}
\subsubsection{Pedagogical Education}
3.5 HP University Pedagogics I.

\subsubsection{Pedagogical Reflection}
When I started working as a teacher, I used very few pedagogical tools other than methods I had used when teaching myself. I was unaware of many of the principles at play in the learning process, including the study environment, role models, the relationship between the teaching activity and the class, the motivation of students, and the work students perform outside of the classroom.

During my teaching, it has become evident that my preconception of the teacher’s role has been focused on a one-way communication from the teacher to the student. The “traditional lecture” as a teaching and learning activity therefore earlier dominated my view on teaching. Naturally, my own education’s teaching and learning activities (TLA) have biased me in this matter since traditional lectures played a central role then. I still believe traditional lectures can be good TLAs, but I am now only using them when I see it fit the context properly. A central part in my teaching now instead involves different forms of \textit{interaction} with the students, preferably in smaller groups (e.g. labs and discussions). I also strive to incorporate practical work whenever possible in order for theory to be put into use.

The knowledge and wisdom from another human being, shared in a personal way, has the power to change. Becoming a teacher should therefore be honoured together with the trust and responsibility that comes with that role. I believe that the most rewarding teaching and best gained knowledge, is formed with mutual and high expectations from both the students and the teacher.
